#### How does it work?

Reflex UI lets you theme your components using style props. The style props are extracted and passed to Theme UI's `sx` prop.
All other props are forwarded.

#### Can I see some examples?

Yes. All the blocks on [reflexjs.org](https://reflexjs.org/library/blocks) are built using Reflex UI.

#### Does it work with color modes?

Yes. Color modes, presets, variants and all other features of Theme UI are supported.

#### Typescript?

Yes. It ships with types and supports Intellisense.

#### Responsive styles

You can use a pipe `|` for responsive values or array-like syntax. They both work.

```jsx
<Div mt="2|4|8" />
```

#### How about hover, focus and other Pseudo-classes?

Prefix the style prop by the pseudo-class:

```jsx
<Button bg="primary" hoverBg="accent" focusColor="secondary">
  Button
</Button>
```

</Div>
