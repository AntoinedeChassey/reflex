## Add a page

Pages are placed in the `content/pages` directory.

Add a new `index.mdx` page.

```
mysite
  └── content
    └── pages
      └── index.mdx
```

The `index.mdx` page is your home page.

You build pages by writing Markdown and React components.

```jsx
// content/pages/index.mdx
---
title: Welcome
excerpt: This is your home page.
---

# Welcome

This is your home page.
```
