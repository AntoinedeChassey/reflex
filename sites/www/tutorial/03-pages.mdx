## Add a page

Pages are placed in the `content/pages` directory.

Add a new `about.mdx` page.

```
mysite
  └── content
    └── pages
      ├── about.mdx // highlight-line
      ├── basic.mdx
      └── index.mdx
```

You build pages by writing Markdown and React components.

```jsx title=content/pages/about.mdx
