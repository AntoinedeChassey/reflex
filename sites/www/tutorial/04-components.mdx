#### Using components

`Components` are one of the most important and useful features of Reflex.

A component is a small reusable piece of content that you can use to build your site.

In Reflex we have made it easy for you to create and style components.

Creating and styling component is as easy as writing HTML. If you know HTML you know how to use this.

We have created components for all HTML tags.

A `button` is a `Button` component. A `div` is `Div` and a `p` is `P`. Easy to remember.
